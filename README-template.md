## Overview

### The challenge

The Challenge was to build out a landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This time i recognized some progression in my understandment for HTML/DOM and CSS. I solved an issue with Flexbox and the header-image--container on my own just with all the things I've learned in the last weeks/month.

There was just one issue I wasn't able to handle by myself. But with the help of the community and the slack-channel I was able to solve this issue as well.
